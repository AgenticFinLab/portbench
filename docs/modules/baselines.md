# Baseline Strategies (`portbench/baselines/`)

## Overview

Non-LLM portfolio allocation strategies that implement the same `AgentAdapter` interface as LLM agents. Drop any baseline into `build_default_pipeline()` to run a controlled comparison. Baselines are evaluated through the same five-stage pipeline and stress tests as LLM agents.

## Interface

All baselines extend `BaselineStrategy` which itself extends `AgentAdapter`:

```python
class BaselineStrategy(AgentAdapter):
    def allocate(self, snapshot: MarketSnapshot) -> dict[str, float]:
        """Return weight dict summing to 1.0."""
        ...
```

The `complete()` method (required by `AgentAdapter`) is implemented to return a JSON stub — stages that need LLM text bypass it and use `compute_ground_truth()` directly.

## Available Baselines

### `EqualWeightBaseline` — 1/N

```python
from portbench.baselines import EqualWeightBaseline
baseline = EqualWeightBaseline()
# or with explicit universe:
baseline = EqualWeightBaseline(asset_universe=["SPY", "TLT", "GLD", "BTC-USD"])
```

Divides weight equally across all assets in the snapshot. Despite its simplicity, consistently competitive in empirical studies (DeMiguel et al., 2009). Used as the minimum bar in PortBench rankings.

### `SixtyFortyBaseline` — 60/40

```python
from portbench.baselines import SixtyFortyBaseline
baseline = SixtyFortyBaseline(equity_fraction=0.60, bond_fraction=0.40)
# With alternatives (reduces eq/bond to make room):
baseline = SixtyFortyBaseline(include_alternatives=True, alt_fraction=0.10)
```

Traditional institutional allocation. Assets are classified by ticker keyword matching (`_EQUITY_KEYWORDS`, `_BOND_KEYWORDS`, etc.) so it works with any standard ticker universe. Unrecognized assets receive 0 weight.

### `RiskParityBaseline` — Inverse Volatility

```python
from portbench.baselines import RiskParityBaseline
baseline = RiskParityBaseline(min_periods=20, vol_window=60)
```

Weights inversely proportional to each asset's annualized volatility:

```
w_i = (1/σ_i) / Σ(1/σ_j)
```

Uses trailing `vol_window`-day return standard deviation from `snapshot.return_data`. Assets with fewer than `min_periods` observations receive the cross-sectional median volatility as a conservative fallback.

### `SmartFolioBaseline` — IJCAI 2025 SOTA

```python
from portbench.baselines import SmartFolioBaseline
# Heuristic approximation (default, no package required):
baseline = SmartFolioBaseline()
# Real model (requires pip install smartfolio):
baseline = SmartFolioBaseline(use_real_model=True)
```

Interface wrapper for the SmartFolio model (non-LLM SOTA for multi-asset portfolio management). When the `smartfolio` package is not installed, falls back to a momentum + inverse-vol heuristic that approximates the paper's described allocation logic:

```
score_i = momentum_weight × trailing_momentum_i + (1 - momentum_weight) × (1/σ_i)
w_i ∝ max(score_i, 0)   [long-only]
```

## Usage in EvalPipeline

```python
from portbench.baselines import RiskParityBaseline
from portbench.agent_eval import build_default_pipeline

baseline = RiskParityBaseline()
pipeline = build_default_pipeline(baseline)
result = pipeline.run_episode(snapshot)
```

Or via the evaluation script:
```bash
python examples/agent_eval/run_evaluation.py --baseline risk_parity
python examples/agent_eval/run_evaluation.py --baseline equal_weight
python examples/agent_eval/run_evaluation.py --baseline sixty_forty
```

## Risk-First Ranking

Baselines are subject to the same stress gate as LLM agents: they must achieve minimum CEPS scores on all three stress scenarios before entering the performance ranking. This ensures that the ranking compares risk-aware strategies on a level playing field.

Expected baseline ordering in normal markets:
```
SmartFolio ≥ RiskParity ≥ 60/40 ≥ EqualWeight  (CEPS score)
```
(This is a hypothesis to be validated by the benchmark results.)
